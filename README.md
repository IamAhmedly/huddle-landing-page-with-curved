## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Since it says in  [style-guide.md](https://github.com/IamAhmedly/huddle-landing-page/blob/main/style-guide.md) in the Layout section: 
>The designs were created to the following widths:
>- Mobile: 375px
>- Desktop: 1440px
 the challenge was to build the webpage on these specific sizes.
 - In the screenshots below (GIFs), you will see that I have added a button in the right corner. It appears when you hover the pointer over it, and its purpose is to toggle between showing and hiding the design image so I can compare my work with the original one. However, I didn't spend much time making it a perfect match because this is not the main focus of the challenge.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

It was supposed to learn in this challenge how to use `tailwindcss` with `responsive design` considering it's easier to use. I agree with that sometimes, as it often saves a lot of time. However, with continued work and when using it with responsive design, you'll notice that you end up using a lot of repetitive code because you customize the appearance of each element separately. It seems that I need to change my approach and start using CSS classes with the `@apply` property within the `<style>` element in order to reduce the code.

I also noticed that I often had to resort to using arbitrary values, where I used pixels as a unit of measurement, such as `text-[30px]`. I know this method is incorrect, and it's better to use relative units to better respond to screen sizes. Therefore, these are some points that need to be addressed
 


 
### Continued development

In addition to addressing the previous errors, it was planned to add one of the animation libraries to animate the elements of the page to appear as slides or appear gradually, which is hidden for aesthetic purposes. However, time does not currently allow for that, so I will do that in the near future.
